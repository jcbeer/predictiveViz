# PredictiveViz
## Interactive predictive model visualization

This code creates a visualization of predictive model using data from the [ABIDE preprocessed functional MRI resting state dataset](http://preprocessed-connectomes-project.org/abide/). The visualization is available at https://jcbeer.github.io/predictiveViz/. 

The goal of the visualization is to illustrate how the predictive map and prediction accuracy change as a function of the alpha and lambda tuning parameters of the elastic net estimator.

This data was also used in [this structured sparse regression methodology project](https://github.com/jcbeer/fsgl). 

The visualization is based on code from [scatterize](https://github.com/njvack/scatterize/). You can upload a CSV file to scatterize [here](http://webtasks.keck.waisman.wisc.edu/scatterize).

It also uses the [Papaya medical image viewer](http://rii-mango.github.io/Papaya/), with code and documentation available [here](https://github.com/rii-mango/Papaya).
